/* ==== OUTPUTS - TIMERS ==== */
/*
 * LASTCOMM_TIME is the length of time (in seconds)
 * that your bot will not reply to a topic already
 * asked. Thus if someone asked your bot about "mirc"
 * that question could not be asked again in the
 * same format for N seconds (or till the question
 * is out of buffer). This prevents the bot from
 * falling prey to users who like to repeat.
 * (default = 5)

/*
 * BELOW is the output timers. Darkbot does not
 * output text without first putting it into a
 * que list. If the bot has several lines of text
 * waiting to be sent, it starts to delay longer
 * and longer between output, so it can't flood
 * itself off of IRC. Explanation:
 *
 * If text in que is < OUTPUT1_COUNT, output it.
 * If text in que is > OUTPUT1_COUNT, delay
 * OUTPUT1_DELAY seconds. If que is > OUTPUT2_COUNT,
 * delay OUTPUT2_DELAY seconds. If number of text
 * in que is higher than OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT, then
 * just delete all unneeded output (ie; any text
 * and notices, but leaving in stuff like kicks
 * and modes) The defaults below are recommended,
 * as the bot isn't going to flood off. If you are
 * having the bot delete output messages and you'd
 * like to increase the que, update the 
 * OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT to a larger number. Just keep
 * in mind if someone floods your bot with a lot of
 * VERSION requests, the bot will sit there outputting
 * a lot of version replies instead of deleting them,
 * causing it to act as if it's just sitting there not
 * doing anything when you ask it something in your
 * channel. (defaults = 4) = 1) = 6) = 2)
